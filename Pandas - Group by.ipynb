    "That's a huge difference in speed and improvement of roughly by two factors. Now, 99 percent of the time you'll use groupby on one or more columns. But you can also provide a function to groupby and use that to segment your data. This is a bit of a fabricated example, but let's say that you have a big batch job with lots of processing and you want to work only on a third or so of the states at a given time. We could create some function which returns a number between zero and two based on the first character of the state name. Then we can tell groupby to use this function to split up our data frame. It's important to note that in order to do this, you need to set the index of the data frame to be the column that you want to group by first. "

This creates a new groupby object. Then we're invoking the agg function on that object. The agg function is going to apply one or more functions that we specify to the group dataframes and return a single row per dataframe/group. When we call this function, we sent it two dictionary entries, each with the key indicating which column we wanted functions applied to. For the first column, we actually supplied a tuple of two functions. Note that these are not function invocations, like np.nanmean with parentheses after it, or function names like \"nanmean\" and a string. They are actually references to functions which will return single values. The groupby object will recognize the tuple and call each function in order on the same column. The results will then be in a hierarchical index, but since they are columns they don't show up as an index per se, then we indicated that another column and a single function we wanted to be run should be run.
